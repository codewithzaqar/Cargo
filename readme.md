<p align="center">
    A browser with almost no UI.
</p>

Cargo is a browser for people that live on the internet and hate mice. Cargo can be controlled using only a few keyboard shortcuts. Cargo only includes the most useful features of a browser, this way unnecessary features can't disturb you while surfing the interwebz. I built cargo, because I did not use most features that my browsers of choice(chrome and firefox) had.

Cargo is still in a very early state, but it is already usable, please help me developing it.

> Binaries will be available very soon!
## Features

 - __Chrome__: Cargo uses electron's webview tags, which are powered by chromium
 - __Tabs__: Like any other browser cargo supports tabs, but it hides them from you
 - __Devtools__: Cargo has full support for chrome's devtools
 - __Cross platform__: Cargo looks good on all platforms, even the titlebar on windows looks good
 - __Simple__: Cargo only has the features most people need
 - __Very cute__: ðŸš‚ðŸš‹ðŸš‹ Choo choo!!
